                <h3>David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever pair of IT Diploma
                    students who handed in a joint research assignment, complete with the required signed
                    statement that it was all their original work.
                    Tune recalls: "Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly impressed to find
                    three pages of the document written in perfect technical German, particularly given
                    that the students in question were none too articulate when I asked 'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'

                "I was told to set up a projector in one of the meeting rooms for school staff,
                as there was a presentation. Having done that, I hooked the presentation laptop
                to the network and tried to help one of the speakers from the IT faculty update
                the laptop to IE7. I logged off and asked her to log on with her account to try
                IE7.

                'What is that?' she asked when the IE7 install process asked whether phishing
                should be turned on. After I explained it, she told me that she was about to
                present a talk on internet security."
