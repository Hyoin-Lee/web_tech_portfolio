                <p>Ian Caldewell, a self-styled 'PC tinkerer', refurbishes PCs, and has ways of
                    acquiring modems, monitors, CPUs, boxes and RAM - to the point where it has
                    become a pastime consuming most of his leisure time. He now has streams of
                    people seeking repairs, advice and assistance.</p>
                <p>"Recently, I replaced an old power supply for a couple, and, when they came
                    to collect, they asked whether I made house calls.</p>
                <p>I said I could and asked what they needed."</p>
                <p>The lady told Caldewell she'd bought a new wireless mouse, and, since it
                    was the last one on display, it didn't come with a box or instructions.</p>
                <p>"I asked her: 'Did you put batteries in it?!'</p>
                <p>She hadn't, of course."</p>

                        <p class="section-paragraph">Chris Aitken, a designer and programmer from Camden, NSW, believes his story
                            proves that tech support is one of the most stressful jobs on earth. He recalls
                            working for a small internet provider in the late '90s, when one of the customers
                            was a local police officer./>
                        <p>"He was also an expert in crashing Windows 98. On one occasion, he brought his
                            tower into the office, sat it on the counter, pulled his service pistol out of
                            his holster and pointed it straight at the tower, threatening to shoot it.</p>
                        <p>Another time he put his (by now very nervous) PC tower onto the counter, again
                            took out his pistol, held it by the barrel and started banging the butt of the
                            gun onto the top of the computer, quite hard too.</p>
                        <p>It's no wonder techies go grey - or bald - early!"</p>
                        <p>This is the first we've heard of someone trying to fix a computer by intimidating it.</p>
