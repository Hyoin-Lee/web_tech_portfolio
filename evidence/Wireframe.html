                    lecturer came to the counter, stating that she'd managed to get a CD-ROM disc
                    stuck in the drive. She also said she felt a bit foolish, because she was
                    instructing a class in basic computing and was unable to solve the problem in
                    front of a room full of students.</h3>

                    floppy disc slot, which was there even though the drives themselves had long
                    since been decommissioned.</h3>
